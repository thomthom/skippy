# Skippy

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/skippy.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/skippy) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/qu5nk3t7g5oaymyx/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/thomthom/skippy/branch/master)

Skippy is a Command Line Interface which aims to automate common developer tasks for SketchUp Ruby extension development.

![](https://github.com/thomthom/skippy/wiki/images/skippy-cli.gif)

It is currently in very early stage of development so many things are incomplete. Feedback and contributions are welcome.

Some of the main goals are:

- [x] Quick initialization of new project with templates
  - [ ] Add/Remove/Update user templates
- [ ] Automate common tasks
  - [ ] Packaging the extension
  - [x] Launch SketchUp
  - [x] Launch SketchUp in debug mode
- [x] Easy interface to add per-project custom commands/tasks
- [x] Library dependency management
  - [x] Pull in third-party modules into extension namespace
  - [x] Add/Remove/Update dependencies

## Requirements

Your system will need a version of Ruby 2.0 or newer installed.

macOS have a system version of Ruby already installed. If you need/want a different version you can for instance use [RVM](https://rvm.io/).

For Windows the easiest way to get Ruby running is using the [Ruby Installer for Windows](https://rubyinstaller.org/).

## Installation

```bash
gem install skippy
```

## Usage

After installing the gem on your system, the `skippy` command should become available.

### Quick-Reference

Type `skippy` to list available commands.

Type `skippy help [COMMAND]` for more information on how to use each command.

Use `skippy new NAMESPACE` to create a new project in the current folder.

You can add custom per-project commands to a `skippy` folder in your project. Look at `skippy/example.rb` for an example of a simple custom command.

### Project Setup

Create a new Skippy powered project by using the `skippy new` command in the project's root directory. Provide Skippy with the extension namespace:

```bash
skippy new Example::HelloWorld
```

Skippy will then scaffold the bare minimum for a SketchUp extension.

Currently Skippy assumes that the source for the extension is located under a directory named `src`.

#### Project Templates

TODO: ...

### Custom Project Commands

In addition to scaffold the extension source code Skippy also creates a directory named `skippy` in the project root. Here it is possible to add custom Skippy commands to aid your project development. For instance running build scripts and other task automations.

Look at the default [`skippy/example.rb`](app/resources/commands/example.rb).

#### Power of Thor

Skippy is built on [Thor](https://github.com/erikhuda/thor). Refer to [Thor's Website](http://whatisthor.com/) and [documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/github/wycats/thor/index) for details on creating commands.

When creating Skippy command use the following replacements:

* Instead of class `Thor`, use `Skippy::Command`
* Instead of class `Thor::Group`, use `Skippy::Command::Group`

### Installing Libraries

Skippy offer a simple library dependency system. It can install a third party library into project workspace where by its various modules can be integrated into your extension project.

The installed library is cached into `.skippy` directory. Don't check this into version control.

When you check out an existing Skippy Project from source control use `skippy install` to install the required dependencies.

#### Installing from Git Repositories

```bash
skippy lib:install https://github.com/thomthom/tt-lib.git
```

#### Installing from Git shorthand.

```bash
skippy lib:install thomthom/tt-lib
```

In the above example Skippy will look for the library `tt-lib` under the username `thomthom` from either [bitbucket.org](https://bitbucket.org/) or [github.com](https://github.com/)

The sources can be altered per project by modifying `sources` in `skippy.json`:

```
  "sources": [
    "github.com",
    "bitbucket.org"
  ],
```

Note that currently all source will be prefixed `https://` and post-fixed with the provided short-name. E.g., `thomthom/tt-lib` will resolve to `http://github.com/thomthom/tt-lib.git` and `http://bitbucket.org/thomthom/tt-lib.git` as `skippy` searches for matching sources.

#### Installing from Local Directory

```bash
skippy lib:install ~/source/my-lib
```

It is also possible to install from a local directory. Pass in the path to the directory that contains the `skippy.json` of the library.

### Using Modules

Once a library is installed its modules can be used within the extension project. List the names of the available modules using `skippy lib:list`.

Once you know the name you can instruct Skippy to use it:

```bash
skippy lib:use tt-lib/gl
```

This will copy the module from the `.skippy` directory and into `src/<ExtensionName>/vendor/<LibraryName>`. At the same time the outer namespace in the source code is changed to match your project's namespace.

![](https://github.com/thomthom/skippy/wiki/images/skippy-use-module.gif)

### Removing Modules

A library module can be removed by using `skippy lib:remove`:

```bash
skippy lib:remove tt-lib/gl
```

This removes the files for that module from the `vendor` directory.

![](https://github.com/thomthom/skippy/wiki/images/skippy-remove-module.gif)

### Uninstalling Libraries

Libraries can be completely removed from a project using `skippy lib::uninstall`:

```bash
skippy lib:uninstall tt-lib
```

This will remove all the library's modules in the `vendor` directory as well as removing the cached library in `.skippy`.

![](https://github.com/thomthom/skippy/wiki/images/skippy-uninstall-library.gif)

### Anatomy of a Skippy Library

Below is an example of a simple Skippy Library:

```
example-library/
├── modules/
│   ├── hello/
│   │   ├── extra.html
│   │   └── extra.rb
│   ├── hello.rb
│   └── world.rb
└── skippy.json
```

Each `.rb` under the `modules` directory is a Skippy Module. In this example the library contains the modules `hello` and `world`.

Each Skippy Module can have a support directories where additional source code or assets can be organized. This support directory must match the filename of the module. In the example above this is illustrated by the Ruby file `modules/hello.rb` along with directory `modules/hello`.

`skippy.json` contains meta data which is required to identify the library:

```json
{
  "library": true,
  "name": "my-lib",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

The `name` value from `skippy.json` is the name that the users will use to refer to the library via `skippy`.

If distributing the library via Git, the `version` value should match the tag from source control.

A library can contain additional files or directories, for instance tests. They will simply be ignored by `skippy`.

For more examples, refer to:
* [github.com/thomthom/tt-lib](https://github.com/thomthom/tt-lib)
* [github.com/thomthom/skippy-test-lib](https://github.com/thomthom/skippy-test-lib)

### Launching SketchUp

Skippy will attempt to locate your SketchUp installations and offer commands to launch them.

These commands provides a cross platform way of launching SketchUp which can be useful in build scripts or IDE automation tasks.

(**Note:** Currently Skippy assumes that SketchUp is installed to its default installation directory.)

`skippy sketchup:list` will display a list of all known SketchUp versions on the system.

![](https://github.com/thomthom/skippy/wiki/images/skippy-sketchup-list.png)

To launch one, use `skippy sketchup:launch VERSION`, for instance:

```
skippy sketchup:launch 2018
```

You can also launch SketchUp in debug mode if the [SketchUp Ruby Debugger library](https://github.com/SketchUp/sketchup-ruby-debugger) is installed.

```
skippy sketchup:debug 2018
```

## Development

After checking out the repository, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

If there are problems installing dependencies try installing them locally and see if that works: `bundle install --path vendor/bundle`

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

### Reminders

Run individual tests: `bundle exec rake test TEST=test/library_source.rb`

Run individual cucumber features: `bundle exec cucumber features/library.feature`
